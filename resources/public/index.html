        <p>Yes, this is a pretty spare website - and that is totally by design. I love the simplicity of the <a href="https://leiningen.org/">leinigen</a> site, and... imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, but also if I can't stop myself from buying domains I may as well have 40 personal web sites. So here's a 'bio', and then some very random thoughts.</p>

            <div><h2>who?</h2></div>
            <div class="justify">I'm a software engineer in salt lake city, working with <a href="https://ctsi.utah.edu/cores-and-services/bmic">these amazing folks</a>. Other spots to see my work are <a href="https://thisapp.digital">thisapp.digital</a> (simple React.Js project), <a href="https://teef.blog">this blog</a> (uses GraphQL/Next.Js for headless Wordpress), this <a href="https://thestore.dev">goofy generic store</a> (Django/Vue.Js), and this slightly old-school <a href="https://tylerford.io/">bio</a> (jQuery!), which has links to other older projects, and a photo from when my hair was long(er. and less grey).
            <p>The code for <em>this</em> site is <a href="https://github.com/tylermorrisford/teefdev">here</a>, but I'd argue most of the interesting stuff is in the nginx configuration. Unless you're into brutally minimal lein projects. But if you are, right on! let's hang out.</p></div>

        <div class="titleRight">
            <div class="justify"><strong>Self Care?</strong></span> 
            <p>I've done more core workouts in the last 3 weeks than I've done in my life, and hoooo boy should I have started this sooner. It hasn't stopped me from continuing to eat like I'm 15, but it has made sleeping easier(less back pain) and any other exercise I might do(trust me, I'm not a gym rat, I'm doughy) is strangely easier.</p><p>Hockey-wise, the nhl playoffs have absolutely delivered - even with my handful of teams no longer in contention - and I guess the question at the moment is, 'who knocks off <s>Tampa</s> <s>the Rangers</s> Tampa?', and I don't have an answer for you. Sorry. On that note, I'm trying to sharpen my Ts chops, so I started on this <a href="https://tylermorrisford.github.io/todays-games-ts/">fan dashboard</a>, based on some really awesome work a couple folks did to document the existing nhl api, which is <a href="https://gitlab.com/dword4/nhlapi/-/tree/master">here</a>. Cheers!</p>
