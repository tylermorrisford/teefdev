        <p>Hi! &#128075; I'm Tyler. Yes, this is a pretty spare website - I love the simplicity of the <a
                href="https://leiningen.org/">leinigen</a> site, and... imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, but
            also if I can't stop myself from buying domains I may as well have 40 personal web sites. I also opt for
            minimalist simplicity almost everywhere else too, if you were wondering. My desk is a mess though. So here's
            a 'bio',
            and then some very random thoughts.</p>

        <div class="titleLeft">

            </div>
            <div class="justify">
                <p>I'm a software engineer in SLC, working with <a href="https://commercetools.com">some
                        amazing folks</a> scattered in the US, Germany, and Spain(and beyond). Previously, I
                    worked in the Biomedical Informatics Dept. at the University of Utah, in the before-chatgpt times. I
                    do enjoy <a href="https://github.com/features/copilot">copilot</a> though.
                </p>
                <p>The code for <em>this</em> site is <a href="https://github.com/tylermorrisford/teefdev">here</a>, but
                    I'd argue most of the interesting stuff is in the nginx configuration. Unless you're into brutally
                    minimal lein projects created by people who know very little about Clojure. But if you are, right
                    on! let's hang out.</p>

            <div class="justify">
                <p>My son and I are having a **really** good time watching the Utah Hockey Club's first season, and it's
                    reminding me of all the times my dad took me to see the fledgling Florida Panthers. It's not lost on
                    me what a treat it is to be able to spend time with him doing something we both love. He has started
                    to play goalie - I'd prefer he continues playing defense(!) - but he's working so hard at it and he
                    loves it. But goalies are weird! </p>
                Code-wise, I'm working on my Ts chops, so I'm tinkering on this <a
                    href="https://tylermorrisford.github.io/todays-games-ts/">fan dashboard</a>, based on the NHL's
                recently updated API. It's a small app but I had just about finished making it completely type-safe
                and then the NHL shut that API down and replaced it with a completely different API. Cheers to them!
