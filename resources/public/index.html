        <p>Hi! &#128075; I'm Tyler. Yes, this is a pretty spare website - I love the simplicity of the <a
                href="https://leiningen.org/">leinigen</a> site, and... imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, but
            also if I can't stop myself from buying domains I may as well have 40 personal web sites. I also opt for
            minimalist simplicity almost everywhere else too, if you were wondering. My desk is a mess though. So here's
            a 'bio',
            and then some very random thoughts.</p>
        <hr>
        <div class="titleLeft">
            <div>
                <h2>who?</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="justify">
                <p>I'm a software engineer in SLC, working with <a href="https://commercetools.com">some
                        amazing folks</a> scattered in the US, Germany, and Spain(and beyond). Previously, I
                    worked in the Biomedical Informatics Dept. at the University of Utah, in the before-chatgpt times. I
                    do enjoy <a href="https://github.com/features/copilot">copilot</a> though.
                </p>
                <p>The code for <em>this</em> site is <a href="https://github.com/tylermorrisford/teefdev">here</a>, but
                    I'd argue most of the interesting stuff is in the nginx configuration. Unless you're into brutally
                    minimal lein projects created by people who know very little about Clojure. But if you are, right
                    on! let's hang out.</p>
            </div>

        <div class="titleRight">
            <div class="justify">
                <p>We moved! After talking about it for years we finally moved to Michigan, so we're in the process of settling in and sorting things out but the kids are doing so well I'm free to overthink all of my own problems! I attempted to get Felix into a low-stress, rec hockey situation, but the area is remote enough that it's effectively a travel team. My complaints end there though; the people, the players, the coaches, are all amazing and we're both having a great time with it.</p>
                Code-wise, I've been neglecting my <a
                    href="https://tylermorrisford.github.io/todays-games-ts/">fan dashboard</a>, and hence! the codebase is a mess. I had just about finished making it completely type-safe
                and then the NHL completely changed their stats API. Anyway, Cheers!
