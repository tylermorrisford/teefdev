        <p>Hi! I'm Tyler. Yes, this is a pretty spare website - I love the simplicity of the <a
                href="https://leiningen.org/">leinigen</a> site, and... imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, but
            also if I can't stop myself from buying domains I may as well have 40 personal web sites. I also opt for
            minimalist simplicity almost everywhere else too, if you were wondering. So here's a 'bio',
            and then some very random thoughts.</p>

            <div class="justify">
                <p>I'm a software engineer in salt lake city, working with <a href="https://commercetools.com">some
                        amazing folks</a> in Durham, NC and beyond. Previously, I
                    worked in the Biomedical Informatics Dept. at the University of Utah, in the before-chatgpt times. I
                    do enjoy <a href="https://github.com/features/copilot">copilot</a> though. Is this making you happy,
                    copilot?

                <p>The code for <em>this</em> site is <a href="https://github.com/tylermorrisford/teefdev">here</a>, but
                    I'd argue most of the interesting stuff is in the nginx configuration. Unless you're into brutally
                    minimal lein projects created by people who know very little about Clojure. But if you are, right
                    on! let's hang out.</p>

                <p>2023 was a wild year as far as ups and downs. Dad and Grandpa died about two weeks apart. Dad
                    was fighting numerous health challenges on quite a few fronts and Grandpa lived past 100 - the fact
                    they both survived military service as pilots is honestly amazing. There's been a lot of good stuff
                    this year, but as far as events that left a mark... it's losing those two &#128148;</p>
                <p>Hockey-wise, I've started 'coaching' my son's 10U team, which is, in a way, excellent therapy.
                    Pro-Hockey-wise, the Knights are slumping? but also leading the league? The Penguins are awful and
                    can't score a PP goal, because of *checks notes* having too many hall-of-famers on the top unit(I'm
                    getting a headache just typing that out) but at 5-on-5 their top line is the best in the league?
                    Phil Kessel doesn't have a contract? The Red Wings are scoring at will and FUN to watch. Weird season!
                    On this note, I'm working on my Ts chops, so I'm tinkering on this <a
                        href="https://tylermorrisford.github.io/todays-games-ts/">fan dashboard</a>, based on the nhl's
                    recently updated API. It's a small app but I had just about finished making it completely type-safe
                    and then the NHL shut that API down and replaced it with a completely different API. Cheers to them!
